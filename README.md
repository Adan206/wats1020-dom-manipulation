# wats1020-dom-manipulation
An assignment designed to demonstrate the ability to manipulate the DOM by creating, removing and modifying elements.

 PLAN: To truly work with the DOM, it's standard practice to use some library to assist. The industry-standard all-purpose DOM manipulation library for the past several years has been jQuery. Students will use jQuery to essentially recreate the same assignment they did previously, but this time they will be given an  HTML file that is completely blank except for the HTML, HEAD, and BODY tags. They will need to use more complex manipulation tools in jQuery to modify the content of the DOM.
